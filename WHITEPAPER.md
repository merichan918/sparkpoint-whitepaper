## INTRODUCTION

The market has a fast-growing demand for fast, reliable, comprehensive, accessible, and low transaction fee payment channels. Existing payment options like money remittance center, online banking and e-wallet for fiat currencies still lack of these features and benefit. Now, people are looking for an alternative which is accessible to all regardless of social status, gender, nationality and location while keeping their sensitive personal information safe from security threats and fraud. Also, an alternative payment channel that is rewarding.

SparkPoint Ecosystem is a ground-breaking payment gateway alternative that will not just provide convenience to the market but will also educate the people on financial literacy and satisfy entertainment needs while rewarding its users. An all-in-one web-based and mobile application using the Blockchain Technology and is integrated to use cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

With SparkPoint Ecosystem, people can now settle utility and credit card bills, pay tuition fees, insurance premiums and online purchases, remit both fiat and digital currencies, and pay for government mandated taxes, licenses and transactions in an incorruptible, transparent and fast manner.

SparkPoint Ecosystem as an all-in-one platform will have four divisions namely, SparkX, SparkRoom, SparkPlace and SparkPlay.

SparkX will provide alternative payment gateway with real-time to almost real-time payment and exchange transaction posting with no to minimal transaction fee{s). This will be made possible by its native token, SPRK, that will stimulate the internal and external transactions. As an innovative financial platform, SparkPoint Ecosystem would reach the financially excluded majority population of the world particularly in the Southeast Asia.

SparkRoom is an integrated library of articles, learning materials and modules to promote financial literacy and stimulate financial inclusion to the mass population. Aside from formal financial education, this also aims to encourage the use and spread the benefits of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology.

SparkPlace is an in-application marketplace where user-members can sell and purchase products and services without using other intermediaries to list products and accept payments. This will be the most inclusive marketplace accepting wide range of cryptocurrencies converted to SparkPoint Token or by using fiat currencies. Different from the existing marketplaces, real rewards will be given to loyal customers and merchants, a reward that has real value and can be converted to fiat currencies.

SparkPlay, a division that will let the users earn rewards by just playing Blockchain integrated games. A truly unconventional way of playing where users will be rewarded by tokens that has real world value which they can later convert to other cryptocurrency or fiat currencies and use in other platforms.

## PROBLEMS

1. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE STILL FINANCIALLY EXCLUDED.

There are seven billion people in the world and as of 2011 around 2.5 billion working adults are unbanked or doesn’t have any quality financial services - 2.2 billion of which came from countries in Africa, Asia and Latina America leaving them to be reliant on cash economy.

Several factors resulted to these large number of financially excluded or unbanked population including but not limited to:

* Low income families’ incapability to meet minimum initial deposit and maintaining balance for bank accounts
* High transaction fees, charges and interest rates
* Lack of financial information
* Self-exclusion
* Disability &
* Geographical Factor

Being financially excluded bars people to basic financial services such as savings account, credit cards, cash, car and housing loan, safe banking and digital payments. Also, having no access to these benefits will force an individual to borrow money from non-bank lenders and illegal loan sharks with a possibility of fraud, redundancy of fees and unexpected costs.

2. HIGH OR EXPENSIVE FEES FOR REMITTANCES, MONEY TRANSFER AND CRYPTO-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS.

International Remittances

A 2017 infographic published by the World Bank shows that international remittances totaled to 585 billion USD with 73% of total remittances went to developing countries. The fees for remittances averages at 7.32% and banks remain to be considered as the most expensive remittance channel or service provider which charge 11.18 percent of the money sent.

In Southeast Asia, largest inbound markets for remittances are Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar and Philippines; large percentage of the senders are overseas workers that pays up to 10% of the money they send for each transactions.

Domestic Remittances/Money Transfer

Money transfer and domestic remittance is an integral part of cash economy in developing countries like the Philippines especially for individuals working far from home (internal migrant).

According to 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) of the Philippine Statistics Authority, 1.4 million Filipinos are moving to a different region. CALABARZON (Region IV-A), Metro Manila (NCR) and Central Luzon (Region I11) are the top destinations of long-distance migrants which covers 27.7%, 19.7% and 13% of total number of these migrants respectively.

Economical need is one of the top reason why individuals are migrating to a different region especially in these top destinations where higher paying jobs are present. With these 1.4 million Filipinos moving from one place to another leaving their family and relatives behind, money transfer industry in the Philippines is vital however, the existing services costs each sender from 3 to 6 percent of the amount being sent depending on the recipients’ location.

Aside from these high transaction fees, long lines and waiting time for transactions are additional burden to both the sender and the recipient. 

Cryptocurrency Exchange

There are more than approximately 2,000 cryptocurrencies circulating in the world today, however, not every cryptocurrency is available from every exchange. Several payment gateways require both merchant and the payer to select the same payment mechanism and this limits the power of one user to another and reduces the value of the cryptocurrency by using several intermediaries before an exchange has to be successful.

3. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE

Fraudulent activities, declined transactions, system going offline, and unauthorized charges are just few of several concerns of any financial institution customers. Though there are many ways to ask for customer support on this digital age, resolving customers’ concern still takes a long time and involves too many processes and documents. These lead customers just to leave it unresolved than to spend time and money more than the value of the time and money they already lost, and/or customer will leave the institution due to distrust and go to another and so on.

Due to complicated requirements to open an account and high minimum deposit leaving the low income families behind, this kills the opportunity to have more potential investors or depositors. This is the type of “customer service” that is profit-driven rather than being customer-centric.

4. LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACY AND OVERALL AWARENESS ON BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.

Lack of financial literacy

Without sufficient financial literacy, people won't be able to identify financial products or services that is suitable to them. This is also a factor why individuals would prefer to save at their own house instead of opening a bank account.

Lack of financial literacy gives people no idea on the importance of banking and using financial services like loans and credit cards.

Lack of awareness on Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology was first used in 1991 and formally introduced as a financial technology in 2008. However, vast majority of people are still not aware on how this technology works. Being unaware of the benefits of this technology, people either refrain from using it or just having no interest in it at all taking the passive approach.

5. NO EFFICIENT KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER (KYC) VERIFICATION METHOD

It is a must and understandable for financial institutions to verify their potential customers’ information, however, with inefficient and near to obsolete KYC method, many have switched banks or don’t open a bank at all.

According to a Thomson Reuters’ survey in 2017, KYC onboarding process takes so long with an average of 24 days to complete the customers’ onboarding process. Some customers also felt that their privacy was being violated since different and more and more information are being asked.

In the Philippines, some banks may just ask for two valid ID’s, initial deposit and proof of billing while most banks require the proof of billing to be under the applicant’s name and proof of income. In a country like the Philippine, renting an apartment or a room is very common even for working individuals which they will not be able to provide proof of billing under their name. And also, not all interested applicants are working, some are just students living away from home and is not capable of showing a proof of income.

These are the top hindrances why 75% of the Filipino adults don't have an access to formal financial services.

6. NO RETURN OF INVESTMENTS FOR GAMERS

All of digital phone users are downloading application and games through App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android, and in-app purchases are also in-demand for gaming applications like MOBA, Casino-inspired games and others. With the conventional gaming application with in-app purchases, money has only one way but go to the developer or the owner of the game.
