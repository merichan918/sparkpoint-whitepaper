## INTRODUCTION

The market has a fast-growing demand for fast, reliable, comprehensive, accessible, and low transaction fee payment channels. Existing payment options like money remittance center, online banking and e-wallet for fiat currencies still lack of these features and benefit. Now, people are looking for an alternative which is accessible to all regardless of social status, gender, nationality and location while keeping their sensitive personal information safe from security threats and fraud. Also, an alternative payment channel that is rewarding.

SparkPoint Ecosystem is a ground-breaking payment gateway alternative that will not just provide convenience to the market but will also educate the people on financial literacy and satisfy entertainment needs while rewarding its users. An all-in-one web-based and mobile application using the Blockchain Technology and is integrated to use cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

With SparkPoint Ecosystem, people can now settle utility and credit card bills, pay tuition fees, insurance premiums and online purchases, remit both fiat and digital currencies, and pay for government mandated taxes, licenses and transactions in an incorruptible, transparent and fast manner.

SparkPoint Ecosystem as an all-in-one platform will have four divisions namely, SparkEarn, SparkLearn, SparkPlace and SparkPlay.

![](images/sparkpoint-ecosystem.png)

SparkEarn will provide alternative payment gateway with real-time to almost real-time payment and exchange transaction posting with no to minimal transaction fee{s). This will be made possible by its native token, SRK, that will stimulate the internal and external transactions. As an innovative financial platform, SparkPoint Ecosystem would reach the financially excluded majority population of the world particularly in the Southeast Asia.

SparkLearn is an integrated library of articles, learning materials and modules to promote financial literacy and stimulate financial inclusion to the mass population. Aside from formal financial education, this also aims to encourage the use and spread the benefits of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology.

SparkPlace is an in-application marketplace where user-members can sell and purchase products and services without using other intermediaries to list products and accept payments. This will be the most inclusive marketplace accepting wide range of cryptocurrencies converted to SparkPoint Token or by using fiat currencies. Different from the existing marketplaces, real rewards will be given to loyal customers and merchants, a reward that has real value and can be converted to fiat currencies.

SparkPlay, a division that will let the users earn rewards by just playing Blockchain integrated games. A truly unconventional way of playing where users will be rewarded by tokens that has real world value which they can later convert to other cryptocurrency or fiat currencies and use in other platforms.

## PROBLEMS

1. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE STILL FINANCIALLY EXCLUDED.

There are seven billion people in the world and as of 2011 around 2.5 billion working adults are unbanked or doesn’t have any quality financial services - 2.2 billion of which came from countries in Africa, Asia and Latina America leaving them to be reliant on cash economy.

Several factors resulted to these large number of financially excluded or unbanked population including but not limited to:

* Low income families’ incapability to meet minimum initial deposit and maintaining balance for bank accounts
* High transaction fees, charges and interest rates
* Lack of financial information
* Self-exclusion
* Disability &
* Geographical Factor

Being financially excluded bars people to basic financial services such as savings account, credit cards, cash, car and housing loan, safe banking and digital payments. Also, having no access to these benefits will force an individual to borrow money from non-bank lenders and illegal loan sharks with a possibility of fraud, redundancy of fees and unexpected costs.

2. HIGH OR EXPENSIVE FEES FOR REMITTANCES, MONEY TRANSFER AND CRYPTO-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS.

International Remittances

A 2017 infographic published by the World Bank shows that international remittances totaled to 585 billion USD with 73% of total remittances went to developing countries. The fees for remittances averages at 7.32% and banks remain to be considered as the most expensive remittance channel or service provider which charge 11.18 percent of the money sent.

In Southeast Asia, largest inbound markets for remittances are Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar and Philippines; large percentage of the senders are overseas workers that pays up to 10% of the money they send for each transactions.

Domestic Remittances/Money Transfer

Money transfer and domestic remittance is an integral part of cash economy in developing countries like the Philippines especially for individuals working far from home (internal migrant).

According to 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) of the Philippine Statistics Authority, 1.4 million Filipinos are moving to a different region. CALABARZON (Region IV-A), Metro Manila (NCR) and Central Luzon (Region I11) are the top destinations of long-distance migrants which covers 27.7%, 19.7% and 13% of total number of these migrants respectively.

Economical need is one of the top reason why individuals are migrating to a different region especially in these top destinations where higher paying jobs are present. With these 1.4 million Filipinos moving from one place to another leaving their family and relatives behind, money transfer industry in the Philippines is vital however, the existing services costs each sender from 3 to 6 percent of the amount being sent depending on the recipients’ location.

Aside from these high transaction fees, long lines and waiting time for transactions are additional burden to both the sender and the recipient. 

Cryptocurrency Exchange

There are more than approximately 2,000 cryptocurrencies circulating in the world today, however, not every cryptocurrency is available from every exchange. Several payment gateways require both merchant and the payer to select the same payment mechanism and this limits the power of one user to another and reduces the value of the cryptocurrency by using several intermediaries before an exchange has to be successful.

3. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE

Fraudulent activities, declined transactions, system going offline, and unauthorized charges are just few of several concerns of any financial institution customers. Though there are many ways to ask for customer support on this digital age, resolving customers’ concern still takes a long time and involves too many processes and documents. These lead customers just to leave it unresolved than to spend time and money more than the value of the time and money they already lost, and/or customer will leave the institution due to distrust and go to another and so on.

Due to complicated requirements to open an account and high minimum deposit leaving the low income families behind, this kills the opportunity to have more potential investors or depositors. This is the type of “customer service” that is profit-driven rather than being customer-centric.

4. LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACY AND OVERALL AWARENESS ON BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.

Lack of financial literacy

Without sufficient financial literacy, people won't be able to identify financial products or services that is suitable to them. This is also a factor why individuals would prefer to save at their own house instead of opening a bank account.

Lack of financial literacy gives people no idea on the importance of banking and using financial services like loans and credit cards.

Lack of awareness on Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology was first used in 1991 and formally introduced as a financial technology in 2008. However, vast majority of people are still not aware on how this technology works. Being unaware of the benefits of this technology, people either refrain from using it or just having no interest in it at all taking the passive approach.

5. NO EFFICIENT KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER (KYC) VERIFICATION METHOD

It is a must and understandable for financial institutions to verify their potential customers’ information, however, with inefficient and near to obsolete KYC method, many have switched banks or don’t open a bank at all.

According to a Thomson Reuters’ survey in 2017, KYC onboarding process takes so long with an average of 24 days to complete the customers’ onboarding process. Some customers also felt that their privacy was being violated since different and more and more information are being asked.

In the Philippines, some banks may just ask for two valid ID’s, initial deposit and proof of billing while most banks require the proof of billing to be under the applicant’s name and proof of income. In a country like the Philippine, renting an apartment or a room is very common even for working individuals which they will not be able to provide proof of billing under their name. And also, not all interested applicants are working, some are just students living away from home and is not capable of showing a proof of income.

These are the top hindrances why 75% of the Filipino adults don't have an access to formal financial services.

6. NO RETURN OF INVESTMENTS FOR GAMERS

All of digital phone users are downloading application and games through App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android, and in-app purchases are also in-demand for gaming applications like MOBA, Casino-inspired games and others. With the conventional gaming application with in-app purchases, money has only one way but go to the developer or the owner of the game.

## MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

The global market using digital payment is expected to have a compound annual
growth rate of 14.1% from 2018 to 2023. With the emerging merchants and billers
who integrate with digital and cashless payment options, payments by cash will
soon be out of style.

In 2017, about 1.7 billion people in the world purchased products using the internet with a total of 2.3 trillion USD sales in the e-commerce industry. Asia Pacific is claims the biggest chunk of this market which covers 12.1 percent of the whole e-retail sales. By the year 2021, e-commerce will be seen to produce almost double the sales with projected amount of 4.48 trillion USD e-retail sales.

![](images/market-opportunities.png)

In 2016, it was projected that in-app purchases will reach $37 billion for 2017. With these in-app purchases, North Americans buy the highest amount when they buy coins, gems or diamonds with the applications they use. Wherein, Asians spend 40% more on in-app purchases compared to the rest of the world.

People born between 1980 - 2000, also known as millennials or Generation Y is approximately 27% of the global population treat technology as a vital part of their lifestyle. This population group uses technology on most of their everyday routine, from socializing, reaching love ones, school and work research, job application up to purchasing gadgets, food and groceries. They are the ones who constantly use laptop or computers, smartphone and internet to do their daily tasks and errands conveniently. In fact, this opened doors for the retailers and other service providers to target consumers where they spend most of their time, the internet.

Based on the latest world internet usage and population report, as of June 30,2018, 55.1% of the world’s population or 4.2 billion people are using internet. Asia being on the top spot which involves 49% of the internet users’ population in the world, while 67 million people from the Philippines is using internet as of December 2017.

By 2019, smartphone users in the world are expected to pass the five billion mark. At present, about 90% of the millennial population possess smartphone and use it throughout their daily routine. Online merchants like Amazon with a global scale operation, Lazada, Zalora, and Shopee which operates in the Asia Pacific offers different payment options including card payments, cash on delivery, Paypal and their own e-wallet. This gives customer convenience of shopping.

According to a March 2016 survey on mobile shopping penetration worldwide, 46% of internet users in Asia and 28% from North America had used their mobile phones and/or tablet computer to purchase or shop. Ina 2017 report, 11% of online shoppers or consumers use their smartphone to shop online on a weekly basis.

Recently, McDonalds food chain introduced the latest technology in their new stores in the Philippines - the McDonalds NextGen stores where consumers will be able to conveniently order via self-service and customer has an option of paying cashless.

With the entire world even the developing countries in Asia and Africa are shifting to technologically-driven payment options to complete their transaction, the use of digital currencies such as Bitcoins and Ethereum are also rising.

SparkPoint Ecosystem sees these financial and market trends as opportunities to educate the masses about financial literacy and encourage the unbanked population to use alternative payment gateways to complete their transaction like shopping online, dining, fund transfer, loan and bills payment.


## SPARKPOINT ECOSYSTEM AS A SOLUTION

### Building a Better Future

## SOLUTIONS

![](images/solutions.png)

SAFE, FAST AND SECURE TRANSACTIONS

The SparkPoint Ecosystem is adopting the Ethereum Blockchain to transact within the platform especially for the SparkEarn and SparkPlace. This ensures that the transaction will be secure, fast and transparent in manner. This technology allows two individuals or entities to perform trading without the need of an outside mediator such as commercial banks, remittance center, therefore eliminating the overhead fees.

Blockchain technology is an open-source digital ledger that contains series of blocks that holds data of the transaction like the sender, receiver and the amount. This technology is known for its high security against fraud, scam and hacking.

According to a report by the World Bank Development Research Group in 2014, digitizing payments will help to lower cost and physical barriers that will suddenly help to increase the number of people with access to financial services through mobile phones, computer, and retail point-of-sales with the support of financial consumer protection network.

Digitizing payments and using Blockchain technology as its core will dramatically lessen the intermediaries between two point of transactions (sender and receiver) that usually is the largest part of operational cost with the existing and traditional payment scheme. Since intermediaries are being eliminated slowly, this will fasten the transaction from request to approval and will lower the risk of potential breach of information.

While this technology provides lower-cost and time-saving benefits to the consumers, this will also provide the same benefits for enterprises and financial institutions by using the available data such as payment transaction and analytics to get more accurate customer profiling, credit risk assessment and potential fraud detection and prevention.

Small and Medium Enterprises will also benefit in this technology especially ones who are engaged in e-commerce by getting the payments by their customers in a very much lesser time once intermediaries and other decade-old KYC verification process has been eliminated with the use of available data in the Blockchain.

WEB-BASED AND MOBILE APPLICATION

SparkPoint Ecosystem’s platforms can be accessed through web and the SparkPoint mobile application. Both website and mobile application designed with a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and transaction. SparkPoint Ecosystem’s web and mobile application version will support both fiat and digital currency.

through the following but not limited to different partner channels like bank,
brick-and-mortar centers, remittance centers, merchant stores and other money
agents. The e-wallet is also integrated to cryptocurrency exchanges to execute
buying, selling and exchanging cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies and vice
versa; also, to maintain the live exchange rate of SparkPoint Token (SRK) and other
to facilitate the conversion of SparkPoint Token with other cryptocurrencies like
Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) and vice versa.

The platform is protected with e-mail and phone number verification, and one-time password (OTP) on top of the user’s own security key. For additional security, users have the option to activate Google authentication factor.

Inter-transfer of fiat currency and SPK Token is free of charge; users will only have to pay for the network fee for transferring other cryptocurrency.

EFFICIENT KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER METHOD

![](images/kyc.png)

SparkPoint Ecosystem will introduce an efficient verification method for clients who will use the platform for financial transactions. There will be different tiers for verification that comes with different transaction limits and access to platform. Each tier will be identified as “Rank” and explained as follows:

*USD 1=PHP 50

SparkPoint Ecosystem will introduce a more efficient and feasible verification method in line with KYC standards of each country (e.g. for Philippines, Central Bank of the Philippines guidelines).

## SparkEarn™

INNOVATIVE, AND LOW-COST ONLINE PAYMENT GATEWAY

Establishing an alternative online payment gateway like SparkPoint Ecosystem will help to achieve the goal for everyone to be financially included. E-wallets and payment gateways will encourage more individual to fully participate in the formal financial system. Achieving this goal around the world will not only benefit the unbanked individuals but also small-medium enterprises up to big enterprises.

Financial inclusion will open opportunities to improve the standard of living for most of the people especially the currently unbanked population. With this alternative financial gateway, financial institution and other financial service providers will be able to reach the marginalized without compromising the risk of their investment returns.

Giving the unbanked population an access to financial services will stimulate positive economic activity since the formerly unbanked population who engages in illegal loan sharks will now be able to access financial services that suits for them like short-term loans, business loans, insurance, and debit and credit services. With low-cost online payment gateways, we will serve as the bridge to provide these formal financial services to the majority of the people while giving them these services at affordable terms, available with proximity to their geographical location, and regulated to protect both consumers and providers.

SparkPoint Ecosystem will partner up with  local banks, brick-and-mortar merchandisers, e-commerce platforms, loan providers, remittance centers, schools and universities, utility and telecommunication services providers and with the government to provide seamless payment and remittance transaction using the e-wallet or the payment processing platform.

To ensure the stability of the SRK value in the market, 10% of the quarterly profits will be used to buy SRK’s back until 25% of all released SRK’s or 5 billion SRK’s are bought back. Proof of buyback process will be announced in the different SparkPoint social channels.

The repurchase and buyback plan will be announced publicly and will be enforced at different phases. After the whole program, the total supply of SRK in the market will be brought down to 15 billion. SRK’s that were bought during the process will be burned and will be taken out of the circulation permanently.
